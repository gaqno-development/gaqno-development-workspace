# Finishing a Development Branch

## Overview

Guide completion of development work by presenting clear options and handling chosen workflow.

**Core principle:** Verify tests → Present options → Execute choice → Clean up.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."

## The Process

### Step 1: Verify Tests

```bash
npm test / cargo test / pytest / go test ./...
```

**If tests fail:** Stop. Don't proceed to Step 2.

**If tests pass:** Continue.

### Step 2: Determine Base Branch

```bash
git merge-base HEAD main 2>/dev/null || git merge-base HEAD master 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Present Options

```
Implementation complete. What would you like to do?

1. Merge back to <base-branch> locally
2. Push and create a Pull Request
3. Keep the branch as-is (I'll handle it later)
4. Discard this work

Which option?
```

### Step 4: Execute Choice

- **Option 1: Merge Locally** — checkout base, pull latest, merge, verify tests, delete feature branch
- **Option 2: Push and Create PR** — push branch, create PR with summary
- **Option 3: Keep As-Is** — preserve worktree, report location
- **Option 4: Discard** — require typed confirmation, then delete branch and worktree

### Step 5: Cleanup Worktree

For Options 1, 2, 4: remove worktree. For Option 3: keep.

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Proceed with failing tests
- Merge without verifying tests on result
- Delete work without confirmation
- Force-push without explicit request

**Always:**
- Verify tests before offering options
- Present exactly 4 options
- Get typed confirmation for Option 4

## Integration

**Called by:**
- **subagent-driven-development** - After all tasks complete
- **executing-plans** - After all batches complete

**Pairs with:**
- **using-git-worktrees** - Cleans up worktree created by that skill
