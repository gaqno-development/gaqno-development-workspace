# No Co-authored-by for Cursor (mandatory)

When creating or amending git commits in this workspace:

- **Do not** add `Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursoragent@cursor.com>` to the commit message.
- **Do not** use `--trailer "Co-authored-by: ..."` or any Co-authored-by line for Cursor or cursoragent.
- Commits must have only the human author; no Co-authored-by trailer for the AI/Cursor.

Use `git commit -m "Subject only"` (single-line message) to avoid a commit template appending Co-authored-by. If the environment adds it via a template or hook, disable that template for this workspace or amend the commit to remove the trailer before pushing.

This applies to all `git commit` and `git commit --amend` commands.
