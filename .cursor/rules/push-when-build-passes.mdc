# Push when build and types pass

After making code changes in this workspace:

1. **Verify**: Run the project build (and type check if applicable). For monorepos or submodules, run build in the repo(s) you changed.
2. **If build passes and there are no type errors**: Stage, commit, and push the changes. Use a short, conventional commit message (e.g. `feat(scope): description` or `fix(scope): description`). Respect the no-Co-authored-by rule; use `git commit -m "..."` and `--no-verify` only if the commit hook would add an unwanted trailer or block a valid message.
3. **If build or type check fails**: Fix the errors before committing or pushing. Do not push failing code.

Apply this after completing a coding task that modifies files, unless the user explicitly asks not to push.
