## 2. Known Architectural Debt

| Item                                  | Severity | Owner    | Jira           |
| ------------------------------------- | -------- | -------- | -------------- |
| Shell overloaded (19 admin pages)     | High     | Frontend | EPIC-1         |
| Types duplicated (backcore/frontcore) | Medium   | Shared   | EPIC-2         |
| DTOs not implementing shared          | Medium   | Backend  | EPIC-2, EPIC-4 |
| finance-ui local API client           | Medium   | Frontend | EPIC-3         |
| useMasterDashboard god hook           | Medium   | Frontend | EPIC-3         |
| admin/saas services stubs             | Low      | Backend  | Documented     |
| Test coverage gaps                    | Medium   | All      | EPIC-5         |

## 3. Deferred Refactors

| Refactor                 | Reason           | Target  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- | ------- |
| Migrate shell admin      | High effort      | Q2 2025 |
| Unify types              | Coordination     | Q2 2025 |
| Padronize error handling | Convention first | Q3 2025 |

## 4. High-Risk Areas

| Area               | Risk             | Mitigation            |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| Shell              | Becomes monolith | EPIC-1 migration      |
| Contract drift     | Integration bugs | EPIC-2; DTO alignment |
| useMasterDashboard | Unmaintainable   | EPIC-3; split hooks   |

| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| frontend-architecture-enforcer  | Violations in admin, saas; any in tests; shell overloaded |
| contracts-types-guardian        | DTO drift; snake vs camel; types duplicated               |
| system-architecture-auditor     | Shell SRP; admin fragmentation; contract-first weak       |
| frontend-documentation-engineer | MFE structure documented; patterns clear                  |
